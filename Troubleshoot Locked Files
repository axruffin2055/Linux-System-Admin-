Troubleshoot locked files:

Some times, backup software can skip processes on files that are has currently in use and locked.
In other cases, we might have a requirement for another process  or a user may need to get exclusive 
access to a file that is already locked by another user or process. How do we combat this?
By gaining information on that file and by gaining information on the process on that file.
In doing so, if the process on the file or the user that is using that file, is not as important
than the task needed for the file right now, then we can use the: kill : command on the process on that file.

Gain info on open files.
This list all open files:
lsof  | less 
Or check directories recursively to look for file by name:
lsof +D /path/to/search -R | grep <file_name>.*     

OR

List the files that user michelle has opened:
lsof -u mwlliams           

Because of the lsof command, we can use the PID to kill processes gracefully 
kill <PID>                        This will kill the process gracefully

Here is another example where we want to kill the process on a port that is in use.
Because port 22 is in use, that means port 22 is locked.

This will get us the PID to kill the process:
fuser -vn tcp 22    
Then kill the process:
kill <PID>   

Please be sure to first use the : man : command and read the manual to all commands 
you do not understand before using the command:
man fuser

Also, there are different ways that the : kill : command can be used giving 
the : kill : command's signal. I have a reference table below:
