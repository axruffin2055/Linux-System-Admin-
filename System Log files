A Linux system can have thousands of log files; these log files can be generated by all types of 
software installed on the system. Most log files exist under /var/log and /run/log/journal.
When we use the : cat or cd : command to read or change into /var/log and /run/log/journal, we will noticed
compressed with GZip.Those compressed with GZip are the result of log rotation that takes 
larger or older log files and compress them to make way for new log files. Also, while using
: cat or cd : command to read or change into /var/log and /run/log/journal, note that some log files 
are either type text file or type binary file. Thus, type text file logs can utilize the : cat :
command and the : cat : command will read/print that log's text information. Now when we try to use the : cat :
command on log files that are type binary files, those files will read/print out garbage. This is 
because log files that are type binary files require a special type of a command to read/print their 
binary log file information.

This will show log files and log directories:
cat /var/log        
cd /var/log      (Changed into a directory)
ls               (View content in /var/log)

We cannot read binary files like this:
cat lastlog

If we want to get the last log-in information for a user account from
the lastlog binary file, we have to use lastlog special command:
lastlog                      (Now we can read lastlog info)
lastlog | grep -v Never      (Omit logs that has the prefix Never)
lastlog -u mwilliam          (Show log-in from that user)

dmesg is a binary file that takes log information for the Linux kernal.
This log is great for troubleshooting devices:
dmesg                       (This is how we view info from dmesg binary file)
dmesg --level=err           (Show kernal messages with prefix err)
dmesg --follow              (Show generated logs in Live real-time)
dmesg | grep -i bluetooth   (Show kernal messages with non-case sensitive prefix bluetooth)

We can also gain added info on the binary file special command:
man dmesg

Remember we are in /var/log directory
cd /var/log 
ls

When we read files that are type text, we may want to use : grep : command to filter the log:
cat messages                   (Will read/print all logs from messages text file)
cat messages | grep error      (Will only print logs with the prefix error)

Hopefully the Linux system is using Network Time Protocol (NTP); therefore, all hosts within that Linux 
system will have synchronized computer clock across that network. That being said, while looking at any log, 
be sure to take note of the {timestamp} because it is important to know when error occurred. Also note the 
{host name} because it will be sad to try and solve a problem using the wrong host. After the host name, 
we will see information on what {generated log entry} such as kernel, NetworkManager, openSUSE dbus-daemon, 
or rocky gnome-session; thus, being able to see who generated the log entry can mark the starting point for 
troubleshooting the problem. With some {generated log entry} we can see a {message ID number}, which is the 
PID for that {generated log entry}. Strictly speaking, we can use log files to troubleshoot errors; 
however, it maybe a good idea to use log files as a preemptive step to look at problems that might be building.

Example:{generated log entry}:NetworkManager, {message ID number}: 1150
journalctl -u NetworkManager --since "2025-07-31 01:45:00" | Grep "1150"

initd will use the old syslog daemon for logging system information. Verse, the newer Linux distributions 
that uses systemd and systemd uses journald for their logging mechanism: 
ls /run/log/journal/bbd1del50...          (A subdirectory under journal directory)
Output:
system.journal                            (This is systemd log type binary file)

Within this subdirectory {bbd1del50...} under journal's directory, we can check systemd journal 
logging by using {system.journal} log type binary file special command:
journalctl               (Print all systemd logs)


system.journal log does not persist, which means logs will not be saved between reboots. 
If we want to change systemd log file {system.journal} default from being volatile and save logs
between reboots, we can edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf:
cat /etc/systemd/journald.conf      (Storage=auto : change it into :Storage=persistent)

journalctl -r      (View the log info in reverse order)
journalctl --disk-usage
