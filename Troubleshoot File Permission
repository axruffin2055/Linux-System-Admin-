Troubleshoot file permission issues. 

Let say we are log in as Michelle Williams and not root.
We can see that the owner is root with read and write permissions. We can see the
group is root with read permission, and we can see everyone else has read permission.
Other or everyone else that has only read permission to this file includes Michelle.
And, yet, Michelle can still delete files from sharedFile directory:
ls -l /shareFiles
output:
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 0 Jul 28  16:01   File1              
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 0 Jul 28  16:01   File2            
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 0 Jul 28  16:01   File3              

This is because if we check the shareFiles directory, we can see that everybody 
(The owner, group, and other) has read, write, and execute on this directory:
sudo ls -ld /shareFiles/
Output:
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 3 Jul 28  16:01  /shareFiles/   

To solve this problem we can set the sticky bit on this subdirectory, which means 
that only the owner of a file and root can delete files in that location: 
chmod o+t /sharedfiles/   
OR                           The +t or the 1 means I'm turning on the sticky bit.
chmod 1777 /sharedfiles/ 

Now we can see the sticky bit turned on. Also, we can only set sticky bit on subdirectories:              
sudo ls -ld /shareFiles/ 
Output:
drwxrwxrwxt 2 root root 3 Jul 28  16:01  /shareFiles/                      

Now lets say the permission on /WebFolder directory is:
sudo ls -ld /WebFolder
drwxr-xr-- 2 root root 3 Jul 28  16:01  /webFolder/              

If Michelle tries to cd or enter into /WebFolder/, she will get an permission denied.                                                    
We can see, as root, that the problem is that there is no execute permission set for others.   

In order for Michelle to be able to change into a directory,
she has to have read and execute permission on that directory:
sudo chmod +x /webFolder/     
OR
sudo chmod 755 /webFolder/
sudo ls -ld /webFolder
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 3 Jul 28  16:01  /webFolder/              
Now Michelle can enter the directory


In order for Michelle to execute or run a script, she need to have read and execute permission on that file.
As we can see, Owner, group, and others do not have execute permission on this file
sudo ls -l /scriptFolder/ 
Output:
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 0 Jul 28  16:01   script1.sh         
sudo chmod +x script1.sh
sudo ls -l /scriptFolder/ 
Output:
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 0 Jul 28  16:01   script1.sh
