Troubleshoot and repair file systems

File systems can become corrupted from a number of reasons such as the system may not have properly shut down, 
while an application was writing to a file, that file became corrupted or we can already have corruption in the 
file system and when we try to access the data, we get an error messages. Otherwise, no errors, when accessing 
data, or mounting file system, should mean the file system is working fine.

Now XFS file systems contains a primary and a secondary superblock. The secondary superblock has metadata 
about the file system such as the file system type, and the status of the file system. Also xfs file system
has it own file system commands to help check, fix and repair xfs fils system.

The xfs_repair command can help us check and repair the xfs file system.
Here, we are using : xfs_repair : command, to analyze volume block with xfs file system type,
which shows there is an error because xfs_repair wants to make changes to /dev/sdb1 file system.
This checks the filesystem without make changes:
xfs_repair -n /dev/sdb1               
Output:
...
would write modified primary superblock                   

Now lets repair the xfs filesystem:
xfs_repair -v /dev/sdb1                     (This will recreate the filesystem)
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/openSUSE          (Now we should not get errors)
sudo umount  /mnt/openSUSE                  (When done, un-mount the filesystem)

We can use : xfs_metadump : command for debugging Corruption, which will preserve the exact structure 
of the filesystem at the time of failure. Also, We can use xfs_metadump for disaster recovery planning 
because xfs_metadump allow us to recreate a partition structure and map, which can help us diagnose 
why something was lost.

When we use : xfs_metadump : command that command will create an stored file system data image.
That image : dumpfile_xfs.img : will contain:
Superblock info
Inode information     (Including file names, permissions, timestamps)
Directory tree structure
Free space maps and allocation groups
B-tree structures   (Used by XFS for organizing data)

Create metadata dump: 
sudo xfs_metadump -o /dev/sdb1 dumpfile_xfs.img           (Create the metadata xfs dump file)
xfs_mdrestore dumpfile_xfs.img /tmp/xfs_image.img         (Restore the dump file for testing)

As for, how to troubleshoot and repair other filesystems that has filesystem types other than xfs?
Use the fsck command:
fsck -n /dev/sdb1        (This get info on device)
fsck -y /dev/sdb1        (This gives permission to fsck to go ahead and repair everything)
fsck -y /dev/sdb1        (Double check the repair)

Please be sure to first use the : man : command and read the manual to all commands 
you do not understand before using the command:
man btrfs

Also, use this table to look for tool verse the file system type.
Example: File system type: Btrfs, will use tools such as: btrfs check, btrfs scrub, btrfs restore.
