Troubleshooting a process.

Check corresponding subdirectory created under that process directory by using the PID.
ls /proc                 (Will show PID list and other directories)
ls /pro/<PID>            (Gain info on where the process is stored)
cat /pro/cpuinfo         (Get info host processor info)

Some time process problems can happen because of low disk space:
df -h        (Check to disk space)


When there are troublesome process that is consuming a lot of memory, we can watch memory usage.
The : watch : command will watch or will check memory every 5 sec using the : df -h : command with option -h:
watch -n 5 df -h                         

We can also follow the log and updates in real-time:
tail -f /var/log/message   

And as a final bonus... Because this command has saved my life while dealing with live monitoring 
hardware events, disk activity, driver issues, USB insertions, and the list goes on:
sudo dmesg --follow       (Continuously prints kernel messages in real time)

Why use: dmesg : command:
- When plugging in USB devices, dmesg will verify device recognition by kernel messages.
- When mounting or unmounting drives, kernel messages will watch for filesystem or errors.
- dmesg kernel messages will help with hardware or driver debugging.
- dmesg kernel messages will allow you to watch live as system halts durning reboot or shutdown issues.
dmesg command is a lifesaver.

Cheers!!!
